<H3>SCRIPTPAD 1.0</H3>
The SCRIPTPAD 1.0 is the most flexible Word Processor than most I have seen(on this site and elsewhere),though it doesn't support MDI Interface yet(I am working on it).<P>
This Word Processor has more than the conventional tools and utilities then most.It out does the others with the following points:-<P>
1.The SCRIPTPAD 1.0 has its own inbuilt e-mail facility for sending e-mail.<BR>
2.It has an inbuilt calculator.<BR>
3.It has an inbuilt graphic viewer and editor(something like paint but not as powerful).<BR>
4.It has an encryption utility.<BR>
5.It has tools to count the number of words or lines.<BR>
6.It has options to change text to UPPER CASE or lowercase.<BR>
7.It has superscripting and subscripting utilities.<BR>
8.It has a small inbuilt program that,if used correctly,can be used to draw fractal like drawings(see included '.rtf' file for tips.<P>
To my knowledge this program contains no bugs,but if you do find them please contact me at my e-mail address anant_ch_15@yahoo.com .(there is a small and insignificant but unnoticible problem in the program to which I had to use weired programming techniques to correct,if you find an alternative then please contact me.)<P> 
Any suggestions and comments are welcome at my e-mail address, and please use my source code and vote for me.
